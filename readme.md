# Zetta

Zetta is a mobile application developed using TypeScript, React Native, and Expo. It utilizes the Expo SecureStore for data storage, providing a secure environment for user data. The app is designed for weightlifting enthusiasts to track their weight progression and create custom workouts tailored to their preferences.

## Features

- **Weight Tracking:** Users can record and track the weight lifted for each exercise on a daily basis. This allows them to monitor their progress over time and make data-driven decisions.

- **Custom Workouts:** Zetta enables users to create personalized workouts by defining custom workout names and exercise names. This flexibility ensures that the app adapts to the user's specific workout routines and preferences.

## Future Plans

- **API Integration:** In the future, Zetta aims to integrate with an external API to enhance its functionality. This could include features such as exercise recommendations, workout analysis, and social sharing among users.
